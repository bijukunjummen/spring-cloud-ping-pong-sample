Up and running with Sample Spring-Cloud based app
-------------------------------------------------

There are two ways to run the entire application:

* On Local Machine
* Using Docker

On Local Machine
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Running it all local is simple, do the following in sequence, in four different terminal windows:

.Start up Eureka
[source,java]
----
cd sample-eureka
mvn spring-boot:run
----


.Start up Config server
[source,java]
----
cd sample-config
mvn spring-boot:run
----

.Start up Pong Service
[source,java]
----
cd sample-pong
mvn spring-boot:run
----

.Start up Ping Service
[source,java]
----
cd sample-ping
mvn spring-boot:run
----

If all the applications have come up cleanly, the endpoint should be available at http://localhost:8080

On Docker
~~~~~~~~~

Running using Docker is even simpler, assuming that docker-compose and docker are installed on your box, just run the following:

.Build the docker images for the microservices
[source,java]
----
mvn clean package docker:build
----

.Start up Docker containers
[source,java]
----
docker-compose up
----

That is it, the endpoint should be available at http://dockerhost:8080
